# HaloHub Website

A single-page launch site for **HaloHub**, a community platform that circulates physical, enriching resources so children can flourish beyond the screen.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience. The page is fully static and styled with `styles.css`; interactive touches (button state + dynamic year) live in `script.js`.

## Structure

- `index.html` – landing page markup with mission, product story, and pilot sign-up forms for families, donors, and collaborators.
- `styles.css` – global design language featuring gradients, glassmorphism, and responsive layouts.
- `script.js` – lightweight enhancements for form confirmation and footer year.

Feel free to adapt the content, integrate with your preferred framework, or connect the forms to a backend or marketing automation platform.
